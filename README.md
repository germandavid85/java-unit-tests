## proposed exercises

- `v0.2`: complete any missing tests for Calculator
- `v0.4`: implement unit tests for PTOPayment
- `v0.5`: implement PBT for Calculator multiplication and subtraction
- `v0.5`: implement PBT Payroll
- `v0.7`: setup the coverage threshold to 72 in the pom.xml
- `v0.7`: implement some test to pass the 72% threshold
- `v0.8`: add another functionality to `TimeReportExtension` to print the final status of the execution, if a single test fails then add  `execution status: FAILED` otherwise `execution status: PASSED`. *Hint:* you may need to use the extension store as in this [example](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-lifecycle-callbacks-before-after-execution)
